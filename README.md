# Tree-Data-Structure

Hi,

This program was assigned as a project for Advanced Data Structures (CSCI - 373). It will read and calculate the diskspace of a directory from your computer and inserts it into a tree data structure. This project will demonstrate my understanding and knowledge of Trees.

Sincerely,

Anthony Z.
